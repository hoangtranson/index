+++

I would like to describe myself in five sentences.

I am a frontend engineer, who loves Javascript, learning new stuff, teaching, writing, PingPong, Bicycle and Workout.

I enjoy solving problems, troubleshooting issues, and finding solutions in a as short a time as possible.

I am someone who is mature, candid and who has integrity. Every day I work to improve myself and my skills which is part of maturing and becoming better at what I do.

I am an optimistic person, who smiles a lot, enjoys little things and spreads positive vibes.

I am a person who is aware of my flaws, learns from my mistakes.
